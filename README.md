MyFirstSVGTest
==============

Basically a working version of the example from the svg-android tutorial

The sample is build in Android Studio with the svg-android library included in the lib folder and the nice Android 
logo graphics as a SVG file.

To make the example work, I had to disable hardware accelleration as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13987288/svg-image-not-visible-in-android-3-0-with-same-code/13992014#13992014)
